#summary This is a brief overview of the Termite Editor.

= Overview =

Termite is an OpenStreetMap editor that is designed for indoor maps. It is a fully functional editor that can edit outdoor data also.

First a few disclaimers:

*Termite is currently in early testing.* Any feedback is appreciated to improve it. And, patience may be required in using it.

*OpenStreetMap currently does not have a standard for making indoor maps.* Termite uses one of the proposed mapping standards. It is also designed so the underlying model used can be changed.

*Termite as currently shipped is NOT connected to the live database. It is connected to a dev database. This database currently has little data. In many cases you will be starting from scratch.

= Getting Started =
 
You need to following to get started with Termite:
 * the java application file (jar)
 * configuration files needed for the program
 * java 6 or later runtime (JRE)
 * a username and password to edit OSM data *on the server http://api06.dev.openstreetmap.org/*
  ** This is the dev server. You can create an account from the URL.

_give instructions for starting program on different platforms_


= Using the Program =

=== Check Out Data ===
When you start the program, the map will be empty. (There is currently no saving of the editor state.) The program is in checkout search mode, which lets you find a region on the map where you download data form the OSM database to edit.

From the map menu, you can select "Base Map" to open a background map.

Then you can navigate using pan and zoom to find the region you would like to open. *NOTE - the search to help find a location is not implemented.*

When you find the area you want to check out, select a rectangle window and then press "download data" to check out map data. 

=== Editing ===

Once you check out data a toolbar is enabled that controls the edit mode. The modes are:

===== Select Mode =====
In Select Mode use the mouse to select objects. A secondary toolbar shows a list of commands that con be done with the selected data.

*NOTE - Generally, dragging the mouse is not used for editing. Actions are done by single clicking the mouse.*

Select -
