#summary This is a brief overview of the Termite Editor.

= Overview =

Termite is an OpenStreetMap editor that is designed for indoor maps. It is a fully functional editor that can edit outdoor data also.

First a few disclaimers:

*Termite is currently in early testing.* Any feedback is appreciated to improve it. And, patience may be required in using it.

*OpenStreetMap currently does not have a standard for making indoor maps.* Termite uses one of the proposed mapping standards. It is also designed so the underlying model used can be changed.

*Termite as currently shipped is NOT connected to the live database. It is connected to a dev database. This database currently has little data. In many cases you will be starting from scratch.
